      <h1>About Blue Book</h1>
      <p><strong>A secure writing space for authentic student work.</strong></p>

      <h2>What Blue Book Is</h2>
      <p>
        Blue Book is a minimalist, AI-resistant word processor designed to help students
        write independently and give teachers meaningful insight into how that writing was produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students compose their work in a distraction-free environment that blocks external pasting
        and quietly tracks writing behavior—like keystrokes, word count, active minutes, and typing speed.
        When they finish, the tool encodes this data invisibly into a simple <code>.txt</code> file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teachers can then upload that file in the verification tool to confirm that the writing
        was completed authentically and view the context in which it was created.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Exists</h2>
      <p>
        AI tools have changed how students approach writing—sometimes in ways that make it difficult
        to tell what’s truly theirs. Existing plagiarism and AI-detection systems focus on
        <em>what</em> was written. Blue Book focuses on <em>how</em> it was written.
      </p>
      <p>
        By analyzing writing patterns and context instead of text similarity,
        Blue Book encourages genuine learning moments and restores confidence in student work
        without turning classrooms into surveillance spaces.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Students Write</strong> — A clean, Notion-style writing space where paste from outside sources is disabled and natural writing metrics are tracked.</li>
        <li><strong>Students Submit</strong> — Essays download as simple text files with invisible embedded metadata.</li>
        <li><strong>Teachers Verify</strong> — The verification tool checks authenticity, word count consistency, and typing metrics to flag possible irregularities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What It’s Not</h2>
      <p>
        Blue Book isn’t an AI detector. It doesn’t score, flag, or punish students.
        Instead, it gives teachers <strong>context</strong>—a transparent look at the process
        behind the final work—helping start the right conversations about learning, integrity, and effort.
      </p>

      <h2>Designed for the Classroom</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple to use</strong> — No logins, accounts, or installations required.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy-first</strong> — No data leaves the browser; everything runs locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessible anywhere</strong> — Works on laptops, Chromebooks, and mobile devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Built for educators</strong> — Feedback from teachers shapes every iteration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>
        Blue Book is currently in an early pilot stage.
        If you’re an educator, administrator, or technology lead interested in testing it with your classes
        or providing feedback, we’d love to hear from you.
